== Every Boat Needs a Captain

((("leaders", id="ixch03asciidoc0", range="startofrange")))Even if you've sworn on your mother's grave that you'll never become a
"manager," at some point in your career you're going to accidentally
trip and fall into a leadership position. This chapter will help you
understand what to do when this
happens.footnote:[Even if you're an individual
contributor and not anywhere near a leadership position, this chapter
will help you better understand your manager.]

There are dozens of books already written for managers on the topic of
management, but this chapter is for individual contributors who find
themselves in an unofficial position of leadership. Most people fear
becoming managers for various reasons, yet no team can function
without a leader. We're not here to attempt to convince you to become
a manager (even though we're both managers now!), but rather to help
show why teams need leaders, why people typically fear becoming
managers, and why the best leaders work to serve their team using the
principles of humility, respect, and trust. Beyond that, we'll delve
into leadership patterns and antipatterns, and motivation.

Understanding the ins and outs of leadership is a vital skill for
influencing the direction of your work. If you want to steer the boat
for your project and not just go along for the ride, you need to know
how to navigate or you'll run yourself (and your project) onto a
sandbar.

=== Nature Abhors a Vacuum

((("leaders","need for")))A boat without a captain is nothing more than a floating waiting
room—unless someone grabs the rudder and starts the engine, it's just
going to drift along pass:[<span class="keep-together">aimlessly</span>] with the current. A project is just
like that boat: if no one pilots it, you're left with a group of geeks
just sitting around waiting for something to pass:[<span class="keep-together">happen</span>].

Whether officially appointed or not, __someone__ needs to get into the
driver's seat if your project is ever going to go anywhere, and if
you're the motivated, impatient type, that person might be you. You
may find yourself sucked into helping your team resolve conflicts,
make decisions, and coordinate people. It happens all the time, and
often by accident. You never intended to become a "leader," but
somehow it happened anyway. Some people refer to this affliction as
"manageritis."

[[deprecated_manager]]
=== Manager Is a Four-Letter Word

((("leaders","and managers", id="ixch03asciidoc1", range="startofrange")))((("managers","and leaders", id="ixch03asciidoc2", range="startofrange")))The present-day ((("managers","origins of")))concept of the pointy-haired manager is partially a
carryover, first from military hierarchy and later adopted by the
((("Industrial Revolution")))Industrial
Revolutionfootnote:[In Europe, it started in the
18^th^ century and in the United States, in the 19^th^ century.]—more than
100 years ago! Factories started popping up everywhere, and they
required (usually unskilled) workers to keep the assembly lines
moving. Consequently, these workers required supervisors to manage
them, and since it was easy to replace these workers with other people
who were desperate for a job, the managers had little motivation to
treat their employees well or improve conditions for them. Whether
humane or not, this method worked well for many years when the
employees had nothing more to do than perform rote tasks.

Managers frequently treated employees in the same way that cart
drivers would treat their mules: they motivated them by alternately
leading them forward with a carrot, and, when that didn't work,
whipping them with a stick. This "carrot and stick" method of management survived ((("scientific management")))((("taylorism")))the
transition from the factoryfootnote:[ For more
fascinating information on optimizing the movements of factory
workers, read up on Scientific Management or Taylorism, especially its
effects on worker morale.] to the modern office, where the stereotype
of the hard-ass manager-as-mule-driver flourished in the middle part
of the 20^th^ century when employees would work at the same job for
years and years (frequently relying on their pension as well).

This continues today in some industries—even in industries that
require creative thinking and problem solving—despite numerous studies
suggesting that the anachronistic carrot and stick is
ineffectivefootnote:[link:$$http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html$$[]]
and harmful to the productivity of creative people. While the
assembly-line worker of years past could be trained in days and
replaced at will, knowledge workers can take __months__ to get up to
speed on a new team. Unlike the replaceable assembly-line worker,
these people need nurturing, time, and space to think and __create__.

[[leader_is_the_new_manager]]
==== "Leader" Is the New "Manager"

((("leaders","as new manager", id="ixch03asciidoc3", range="startofrange")))Most people still use the title "manager" despite the fact that it's
often an anachronism. We think the term __manager__ should be
eliminated and the term __leader__ should be used instead. While we're
hardly members of the stalwart, politically correct crowd, the word
__manager__ has become a four-letter word—a role whose very existence
encourages new managers to __manage__ their __reports__. Managers wind
up acting like parents,footnote:[If you have kids,
the odds are good that you can remember with startling clarity the
first time you said something to your child that made you stop and
exclaim (perhaps even aloud): "Holy crap, I've become my mother."] and
consequently employees react like children. ((("HRT (humility, respect, trust)","leadership and")))((("trust","leadership and")))To frame this in the
context of HRT: if the manager makes it obvious that she trusts her
employee, the employee feels positive pressure to live up to that
trust. It's that simple. A leader forges the way for a team, looking
out for their safety and well-being, all while making sure their needs
are met. If there's one thing you remember from this chapter, make it
this:

Fitz had a new engineer join his team a few years ago. Jerry's last
manager (at a different company) was adamant that Jerry be at his desk
from 9:00 to 5:00 every day, and assumed that if Jerry wasn't there,
Jerry wasn't working enough (which is, of course, a ridiculous
assumption). On his first day working with Fitz, Jerry came to Fitz at
4:40 p.m. and stammered out an apology that he had to leave 15 minutes
early because he had an appointment that he had been unable to
reschedule. Fitz looked at him, smiled, and told him flat out, "Look,
as long as you get your job done, I don't care __what__ time you leave
the office." Jerry stared blankly at Fitz for a few seconds, nodded,
and went on his way. Fitz treated Jerry like an adult, Jerry always
got his work done, and Fitz never
had to worry about Jerry being at his desk, because Jerry didn't
__need__ a babysitter.

((("responsibility","leadership and")))Being a "leader" doesn't necessarily mean you have ultimate
responsibility for absolutely everything. There are different types of
leadership, some technical and some personal. In the software
development world, there are two distinct roles (and titles) for
people leading a team: TL (tech lead) and TLM (tech lead manager).footnote:[We
use the word __manager__ here to mean nothing more than "has people
who are reporting to her," as opposed to "must bark commands at
people."] A TL is typically responsible for the technical direction
for all (or part) of a product, while a TLM is responsible for the
technical direction for all (or part) of a product in addition to the
careers and happiness of the people on the team. This enables those
who want to focus on leading a project to avoid the people management
part of being a leader if they want to.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc3")))

[[the_only_thing_to_fear_is_hellip_well_ev]]
==== The Only Thing to Fear Is…Well, Everything

((("leaders","reasons not to become")))Aside from the general sense of malaise that most people feel when
they hear the word __manager__, there are a number of reasons that
most people don't want to become managers. The biggest reason you'll
hear in the software development world is that you spend much less
time writing code, which is true whether you're a technical leader or
a people leader. We'll talk more about that later, but first, some
more reasons why most of us avoid becoming managers.

If you've spent the majority of your career writing code, you
typically end a day with something you can point to—whether it's code,
a design document, or a pile of bugs you just closed—and say, "That's
what I did today." Based on this metric of productivity, at the end of
a busy day of "management" you'll usually find yourself thinking, "I
didn't do a __damned thing__ today." It's the equivalent of spending
years counting the number of apples you picked each day, and changing
to a job picking bananas, only to say to yourself at the end of each
day, "I didn't pick any apples," handily ignoring the giant pile of
bananas sitting next to you. Quantifying management work __is__ more difficult than
counting widgets you turned out, and you don't have to take credit for
your team's work; however, making it possible for them to be happy and
productive is a big measure of your job. Just don't fall into the trap
of counting apples when you're picking bananas.


[[image_no_caption-id017]]
image::images/dbtm_03in03.png[]

((("Peter Principle")))Another big reason for not becoming a manager is often unspoken but
rooted in the famous "Peter Principle," which
states that, "In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level
of incompetence." Most people have had a manager who was incapable of
doing her job or was just really bad at managing
people,footnote:[Yet another reason companies
shouldn't force people into management as part of a career path: if an
engineer is able to write reams of great code and has no desire at all
to manage people or lead a team, by forcing her into a management or
tech lead role you're losing a great engineer and gaining a crappy
manager. This is not only a bad idea, but it's actively harmful.] and
we know some people who have __only__ worked for bad managers. If
you've only been exposed to crappy managers for your entire career,
why would you ever want to __be__ a manager? Why would you want to be
promoted to a role that you weren't able to do?

There are great reasons to consider becoming a manager: first, it's a
way to scale yourself. Even if you're great at writing code, there's
still an upper limit to the amount of code you can write. Imagine how
much code a team of great engineers could write under your leadership!
Second, you might just be really good at it—many people who find
themselves sucked into the leadership vacuum of a project discover
that they're exceptionally skilled at providing the kind of guidance,
help, and air cover a team needs.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc2")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc1")))

[[the_servant_leader]]
=== The Servant Leader

((("leaders","servant")))((("servant leaders")))There seems to be a sort of disease that strikes new managers where
they forget about all the awful things __their__ managers did to them
and suddenly start doing these same things to "manage" the people that
report to them. The symptoms of this disease include, but are by no
means limited to, micromanaging, ignoring low performers, and hiring
pushovers. Without prompt treatment, this disease can kill an entire
team. The best advice we got when we first became managers at Google
was from Steve((("Vinter, Steve"))) Vinter, an engineering
director. He said, "Above all, resist the urge to manage."  One of the
greatest urges of the newly minted manager is to actively "manage" her
employees because that's what a manager does, right? This typically
has disastrous consequences.

The cure for the "management" disease is a liberal application of what
we call "servant leadership," which is a nice way of saying the most important thing a
leader can do is to serve her team, much like a butler or majordomo
tends to the health and well-being of a household. ((("HRT (humility, respect, trust)","and servant leaders")))As a servant
leader, you should strive to create an atmosphere of humility,
respect, and trust (HRT). This may mean removing bureaucratic
obstacles that a team member can't remove by herself, helping a team
achieve consensus, or even buying dinner for the team when they're
working late at the office. The servant leader fills in the cracks to
smooth the way for her team and advises them when necessary, but
still isn't afraid of getting her hands dirty. The only managing that
a servant leader does is to manage both the technical __and__ social
health of the team; as tempting as it may be to focus purely on the
technical health of the team, the social health of the team is just as
important (but often infinitely harder to manage!).

[[antipatterns]]
=== Antipatterns

((("leaders","antipatterns for", id="ixch03asciidoc4", range="startofrange")))((("leaders","behaviors to avoid", id="ixch03asciidoc5", range="startofrange")))Before we go over a litany of "design patterns" for successful
leaders, we're going to review a
collection of the patterns you __don't__ want to follow if you want to
be a successful leader. We've observed these destructive patterns in a
handful of bad leaders we've encountered in our careers, and in more
than a few cases, pass:[<span class="keep-together">ourselves</span>].footnote:[See the section
on failure, in <<building_an_awesome_team_culture>>.]

[[antipattern_hire_pushovers]]
==== Antipattern: Hire Pushovers

((("antipatterns, leadership","hiring pushovers")))((("pushovers")))If you're a manager and you're feeling insecure in your role (for
whatever reason), one way to make sure no one questions your authority
or threatens your job is to hire people you can push around. You can
achieve this by hiring people who aren't as smart or ambitious as you
are, or just people who are more insecure than you. While this will
cement your position as the team leader and decision maker, it will
mean a lot more work for you. Your team won't be able to make a move
without you leading them like dogs on a leash. If you build a team of
pushovers, you probably can't take a vacation; the moment you leave
the room, productivity comes to a screeching halt. But surely this is
a small price to pay for feeling secure in your job, right?

Instead, you should strive to hire people who are smarter than you and
can replace you. This can be difficult because these very same people
will challenge you on a regular basis (in addition to letting you know
in no uncertain terms when you screw up). These very same people will
also consistently impress you and make great things happen. They'll be
able to direct themselves to a much greater extent, and some will be
eager to lead the team as well. You shouldn't see this as an attempt
to usurp your power, but rather as an opportunity for you to lead an
additional team, investigate new opportunities, or even take a
vacation without worrying about checking in on the team every day to
make sure they're getting their work done.

[[antipattern_ignore_low_performers]]
==== Antipattern: Ignore Low Performers

((("antipatterns, leadership","ignoring low performers")))((("low performers")))Early in Fitz's career as a team leader at Google, the time came for
him to hand out bonus letters to his team, and he grinned as he told
his manager, "I __love__ being a manager!" Without missing a beat,
Fitz's manager, a long-time industry veteran, replied, "Sometimes you
get to be the tooth fairy, other times you have to be the
dentist."

It's never any fun to pull teeth. We've seen team leaders do all the
right things to build incredibly strong teams, only to have these
teams fail to excel (and eventually fall apart) because of just one or
two low performers. We understand that the human
aspect is the hardest part of writing software, but the hardest part
of dealing with humans is handling someone who isn't meeting
expectations. Sometimes people miss expectations because they're not
working long enough or hard enough, but the most difficult cases are
when someone just isn't capable of doing his job no matter how long or
hard he works.

((("hope, limitations of")))The team at Google that is responsible for keeping all of their
services running has a motto: "Hope is not a strategy." And nowhere is hope more overused as a strategy
than in dealing with a low performer. Most team leaders grit their
teeth, avert their eyes, and just hope that the low performer either
magically gets better or just goes away. Yet it is extremely rare that
this person does either.

While the leader is hoping and the low performer isn't getting better
(or leaving), high performers on the team waste valuable time pulling
the low performer along and team morale leaks away into the ether. You
can be sure that the team knows they're there even if you're ignoring
them—the rest of the team is acutely aware of who the low performers are, because they have to carry
them.

Ignoring
low performers is also a way to keep new high performers from joining
your team, and a way to encourage existing high performers to
leave. You eventually wind up with a whole team of low performers
because they're the only ones who __can't__ leave of their own
volition. Lastly, you aren't even doing __the low performer__ any
favors by keeping him on the team; often, someone who wouldn't do well
on your team would actually have plenty of impact somewhere else.

The benefit of dealing with a low performer as quickly as possible is
that you can put yourself in the position of helping him up __or__
out. If you deal with a low performer right away, you'll oftentimes
find that he merely needs some encouragement or direction to slip into
a higher state of productivity. If you wait too long to deal with a
low performer, his relationship with the team is
going to be so sour and you're going to be so frustrated that you're
not going to be able to help him.

How does one coach a low performer effectively? It turns out
that the two of us have (unfortunately) had quite a lot of experience
in this area, gained through painful trial and error. The best
analogy is to imagine you're helping a limping person learn to walk
again, then jog, then run alongside the rest of the team. It almost
always requires temporary micromanagement—but still a whole lot of
HRT, particularly respect. Set up a specific time frame (say, two or
three months), and some very specific goals you expect him to achieve
in that period. Make the goals small and incremental, so there's an
opportunity for lots of small successes. Meet with the team member
every week to check on progress, and be sure you set really explicit
expectations around each upcoming milestone, so it's easy to measure
success or failure. If the low
performer can't keep up, it will become quite obvious to __both__ of
you early in the process. At this point, the person will often
acknowledge that things aren't going well and decide to quit; in other
cases, determination will kick in and he'll "up his game" to meet
expectations. Either way, by working directly with the low performer
you're catalyzing important and necessary changes.

[[antipattern_ignore_human_issues]]
==== Antipattern: Ignore Human Issues

((("antipatterns, leadership","ignoring human issues")))((("human issues, ignoring")))As we've said before, a team leader has two major areas of focus for
his team: the social and the technical. It's rather common for leaders
to be stronger in the technical side, and since most leaders are
promoted from a technical job (where the primary goal of their job was
to solve technical problems), they tend to ignore human issues. It's
tempting to focus all your energy on the technical side of your team
because, as an individual contributor, you spend the vast majority of your time
solving technical problems. When you were a student, your
classes were all about learning the technical ins and outs of your
work. Now that you're a leader, however, you ignore the human element
of your team at your own peril.

Let's start with an example of a leader ignoring the human element in his team. Years
ago, a close friend of Fitz's—we'll call him
Jake—had his first child. Jake and Fitz had worked together for years, both remotely and
in the same office, so in the weeks following the arrival of the new
baby, Jake worked from home. This worked out great for Jake and his
wife, and Fitz was totally fine with it as he was already used to
working remotely with Jake. They were their usual productive selves
until their manager, Pablo (who worked in a different office), found
out that Jake was working from home for most of the week. Pablo was
upset that Jake wasn't going into the office to work with Fitz,
despite the fact that Jake was just as productive as always and that
Fitz was fine with the situation. Jake attempted to explain to Pablo
that he was just as productive as he would be if he came into the
office, and that it was much easier on both him and his wife for him
to mostly work from home for a few weeks. Pablo's response: "Dude,
people have kids __all the time__. You need to go into the office."
Needless to say, Jake (normally a mild-mannered engineer) was enraged
and lost a lot of respect for Pablo.

There are numerous ways that Pablo could have handled this
differently: he could have showed some understanding that Jake wanted
to be home more for his wife and, if his productivity and team weren't
being affected, just let
him continue to do so for a while. He could have negotiated that Jake
go into the office for one or two days a week until things settled
down. Regardless of the end result, a little bit of empathy would have
gone a long way toward keeping Jake happy in this situation.

[[antipattern_be_everyones_friend]]
==== Antipattern: Be Everyone's Friend

((("antipatterns, leadership","being everyone's friend")))((("friendships","and leadership antipatterns")))The first foray that most people have into leadership is when they
become the lead of a team of which they were formerly members. Many
leads don't want to lose the friendships they've
cultivated with their teams, so they will sometimes work extra hard to
maintain friendships with their team members after becoming a team
lead. This can be a recipe for disaster and for a lot of broken
friendships. Don't confuse friendship with leading with a soft touch:
when you hold power over someone's career, he may feel pressure to
artificially reciprocate gestures of friendship.

Remember that you can lead a team and build consensus without being a
peer of your team (or a monumental hard-ass). Likewise, you can be a
tough leader without tossing your existing friendships to the
wind. We've found that having lunch with your team can be an effective
way to stay socially connected to them without making them
uncomfortable—this gives you a chance to have informal conversations
outside the normal work environment.

Sometimes it can be tricky to move into a management role over someone
who has been a good friend and a peer. If the friend who is
being managed is not self-managing and is not a hard worker,
it can be stressful for everyone. We recommend that you avoid getting
into this situation whenever possible.

[[antipattern_compromise_the_hiring_bar]]
==== Antipattern: Compromise the Hiring Bar

((("antipatterns, leadership","compromising the hiring bar")))((("hiring, compromised standards for")))Steve Jobs once((("Jobs, Steve"))) said: &#x201c;__A__ people hire other
__A__ people; __B__ people hire __C__ people." It's incredibly easy to
fall victim to this adage, and even more so when you're trying to hire
quickly. A common approach we've seen is that a team needs to hire
five engineers, so they sift through their pile of applications,
interview 40 or 50 people, and pick the best 5 __regardless of
whether they meet the hiring bar__. This is one of the fastest ways to
build a mediocre team.

The cost of finding the right person—whether by paying recruiters,
paying advertising, or pounding the pavement for references—pales in
comparison to the cost of dealing with an employee you never should
have hired in the first place. This "cost" manifests itself in lost
team productivity, team stress, time spent managing the employee up or
out, and the paperwork and stress involved in firing the
employee. That's assuming, of course, that you try to avoid the
monumental cost of just leaving him on the team. If you're managing a
team where you don't have a say over hiring and you're unhappy with
the hires being made for your team, you need to fight tooth and nail
for higher-quality engineers. If you still keep getting handed
substandard engineers, maybe it's time to look for another
job. Without the raw materials for a great team, you're
doomed.

[[antipattern_treat_your_team_like_childre]]
==== Antipattern: Treat Your Team Like Children

((("antipatterns, leadership","treating team like children")))((("children, treating team like")))((("disrespect")))((("micromanagement")))((("trust","and micromanagement")))The best way to show your team you don't trust them is to treat them
like kids—people tend to act the way you treat them, so if you treat
them like children or prisoners, don't be surprised when that's how
they behave. You can manifest this behavior by micromanaging them or
simply by being disrespectful of their abilities and giving them no
opportunity to be responsible for their work. If it's permanently
necessary to micromanage people because you don't trust them, you've
got a hiring failure on your hands. Well, it's a failure unless your
goal was to build a team that you can spend the rest of your life
babysitting. If you hire people worthy of trust and show these people
you trust them, they'll usually rise to the occasion (sticking with
the basic premise, as we mentioned earlier, that you've hired good
people).

Fitz runs a conference in Chicago that used to be at a site rented
from a local institution. The first time Fitz went to get access to
the venue for the conference, the facilities manager gave Fitz a brief
tour of the place to make sure he knew where everything was. The
manager then handed him the key to the building and told Fitz that
he'd get the key back from him next week. There was no list of "dos
and dont's," and no extensive supervision for the event, and as a
result Fitz and his team felt responsible for taking take care of the
facility as though it were their own, going above and beyond the
expectations of keeping the place clean and organized.

The results of this level of trust go all the way from keys to a
building to office and computer supplies. As another example, Google
provides employees with cabinets stocked with various and sundry
office supplies (e.g., pens, notebooks, and other "legacy" implements
of creation) that are free to take as employees need them. The IT
department runs numerous "Tech Stops" that provide self-service areas
that are like a mini electronics store. These contain lots of computer
accessories and doodads (e.g., power supplies, cables, mice, USB
drives, etc.) that would be easy to just grab and walk off with,
but since Google employees are being entrusted to check these items out,
they feel a responsibility to Do The Right Thing. Many people from
typical corporations react in horror to hearing this, exclaiming that
surely Google is hemorrhaging money due to people "stealing" these
items. That's certainly possible, but what about the costs of having a
workforce that behaves like children? Surely that's more
expensive than the price of a few pens and USB cables.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc5")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc4")))

[[leadership_patterns]]
=== Leadership Patterns

((("leaders","patterns for effective", id="ixch03asciidoc6", range="startofrange")))((("patterns, leadership", id="ixch03asciidoc7", range="startofrange")))These are a collection of behavior patterns for successful leadership
that we've learned from experience, from watching other successful
leaders, and, most of all, from our own leadership mentors. These
patterns are not only those that we've had great success implementing,
but the patterns that we've always respected the most in the leaders
that we follow.

[[lose_the_ego-id001]]
==== Lose the Ego

((("ego","and effective leadership")))((("patterns, leadership","losing the ego")))We talked about "losing the ego" in
<<the_myth_of_the_genius_programmer>> when we first examined HRT, but
it's especially important when you're playing the role of servant
leader. This pattern is frequently misunderstood as encouraging
leaders to be a doormat and let their team walk all over them, but
that's not the case at all. We admit that there's a fine line between
being humble and letting others take advantage of you, but humility is
__not__ the same as lacking confidence. You can still have
self-confidence and opinions without being an
egomaniac. Big personal egos are hard to handle on any team,
especially in the team's leader. Instead, you should work to cultivate
a strong((("team ego"))) collective __team__ ego and identity.

Part of "losing the ego" is
something we've covered already: you need to trust your team. That
means respecting the abilities and prior accomplishments of the team
members, even if they're new to your team.

If you're not micromanaging your team, you can be pretty certain the
folks working in the trenches know the details of their work better
than you do. This means that while you may be the one driving the team
to consensus and helping to set the direction, the nuts and bolts of
how to accomplish your goals are best decided by the people who are
putting the product together. This gives them not only a greater sense
of ownership, but also a greater sense of accountability and
responsibility for the success (or failure!) of their product. If
you've got a good team and you let them set the bar for the quality
and rate of their work, they'll accomplish more than they would by you
standing over them with a carrot and a stick.

Most people new to a leadership role feel an enormous responsibility
to get everything right, to know everything, and to have all the
answers. We can assure you that you will not get everything right, nor
will you have all the answers, and if you act like you do, you'll
quickly lose the respect of your team. A lot of this comes down to
having a basic sense of security in your role. Think back to when you
were an individual contributor; you could smell insecurity a mile
away. Try to appreciate inquiry: when someone questions a decision or
statement you made, remember that this person is usually just trying
to better understand you. If you encourage inquiry, you're much more
likely to get the kind of constructive
criticism that will make you a better leader of a better team. Finding
people who will give you good constructive criticism is incredibly difficult, and
it's even harder to get this kind of criticism from people who "work
for you." Think about the big picture of what you're trying to
accomplish as a team, and accept feedback and criticism openly; avoid
the urge to be territorial.

The last part of losing the ego is a simple one,
but many engineers would rather be boiled in oil than do it: apologize
when you make a mistake. And we don't mean you should just sprinkle
"I'm sorry" throughout your conversation like salt on popcorn—you have
to sincerely mean it. You are absolutely going to make mistakes, and
whether you admit it or not your team is going to know you've made a
mistake. They'll know regardless of whether they talk to you or not
(and one thing is guaranteed: they __will__ talk about it with one
another). Apologizing doesn't cost
money. People have enormous respect for leaders who apologize when they screw up, and contrary
to popular belief it doesn't make you vulnerable. In fact, you'll
usually gain respect from people when you apologize, because
apologizing tells people you are level-headed, good at assessing
situations, and—coming back to HRT—humble.

and cynicism, but this can be a liability when you're trying to lead a
team. That's not to say you should be naïvely optimistic at every
turn, but you would do well to be less vocally skeptical while still
letting your team know you're aware of the intricacies and obstacles
involved in your work. Mediating your reactions and maintaining your
calm is more important as you lead more people, because your team will
(both unconsciously and consciously) look to you for clues on how to
act and react to whatever is going on around you.


[[image_no_caption-id018]]
image::images/dbtm_03in04.png[]

((("chain of gears, org chart as")))((("org chart, chain of gears analogy for")))A simple way to visualize this effect is to see your company's org
chart as a chain of gears, with the individual contributor as a tiny
gear with just a few teeth all the
way at one end, and each successive manager above her as another gear,
ending with the CEO as the largest gear with many hundreds of
teeth. This means every time that individual's "manager gear" (with
maybe a few dozen teeth) makes a single revolution, the "individual's
gear" makes two or three revolutions. And the CEO can make a small
movement and send the hapless employee, at the end of a chain of six
or seven gears, spinning wildly! The farther you move up the chain,
the faster you can set the gears below you spinning, whether you
intend to or not.


[[image_no_caption-id019]]
image::images/dbtm_03in05.png[]

Another way of thinking about this is the maxim that the __leader is
always on stage.__ This means that if you're in an overt leadership
position, you are always being watched: not just when you run a
meeting or give a talk, but even when you're just sitting at your desk
answering emails.  Your peers are watching you for subtle clues in
your body language, your reactions to small talk, and your signals as
you eat lunch.  Do they read confidence or fear?  As a leader, your
job is to inspire, but inspiration is a 24/7 job.  Your visible
attitude about absolutely everything--no matter how trivial--is
unconsciously noticed and spreads infectiously to your team.

Fitz had a manager, Bill,footnote:[His real name.]
who truly mastered the ability to maintain calm at all times. No
matter what blew up, no matter what crazy thing happened, no matter
how big the firestorm, Bill would never panic. Most of the time he'd
place one arm across his chest, rest his chin in his hand, and ask
questions about the problem, usually to a completely panicked
employee. This had the effect of calming her and helping her to focus
on solving the problem instead of running around in a
chicken-with-its-head-cut-off mode. Fitz used to joke that if someone
came in and told Bill 19 of the company's offices had been attacked by
space aliens, Bill's response would be, "Any idea why they didn't make
it an even 20?"

((("questions, asking","for effective leadership")))This brings us to another Zen
management trick: asking questions. When a team member asks you for
advice, it's usually pretty exciting because you're finally getting
the chance to fix something! That's exactly what you did for years
before moving into a leadership position, so you usually go
__leaping__ into solution mode, but that is the last place you should
be. The person asking for advice typically doesn't want you to solve
her problem, but rather to help __her__ solve it, and the easiest way
to do this is to ask her questions. This isn't to say you should
replace yourself with a Magic 8 Ball, which would be maddening and
unhelpful. Instead, you can apply some HRT and try to help her solve
the problem on her own by trying to refine and explore her
problem. This will usually lead the employee to the
answer,footnote:[See also "Rubber duck
debugging,"
link:$$http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging$$[].] and it
will be __her__ answer, which leads back to the ownership and
responsibility we went over earlier in this chapter. Whether you have
the answer or not, using this technique will almost always leave the
employee with the impression that you did. Tricky, eh? Socrates would
be proud of you.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc11")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc10")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc9")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc8")))

[[be_a_catalyst]]
==== Be a Catalyst

((("catalyst, leader as", id="ixch03asciidoc12", range="startofrange")))((("patterns, leadership","being a catalyst", id="ixch03asciidoc13", range="startofrange")))In chemistry a catalyst is something that accelerates a chemical
reaction, but which itself is not consumed in the reaction. One of the
ways in which catalysts (e.g., enzymes) work is to bring
reactants into close proximity: instead of bouncing around randomly in
a solution, the reactants are much more likely to favorably interact
with one another when the catalyst helps bring them together. This is
a role you'll often need to play as a leader, and there are a number
of ways you can go about it.

((("consensus building")))One of the most common things a team leader does is to build
consensus. This may mean you drive the process from start to finish,
or you just give it a gentle push in the right direction to speed it
up. Working to build team consensus is a leadership skill that is
often used by unofficial leaders because it's one
way you can lead without any actual authority. If you have the
authority, you can direct and dictate direction, but that's less
effective overall than building consensus. If your team is looking to
move quickly, sometimes they'll voluntarily concede authority and
direction to one or more team leads. While this might look like a
dictatorship or oligarchy, when it's done voluntarily it's a form of
pass:[<span class="keep-together">consensus</span>].

[[note-4-5]]
.Know Where to Put the Chalk Mark
****
There's a story about a Master of all things mechanical who had long
since retired. His former company was having a problem that no one
could fix, so they called in the Master to see if he could help find
the problem. The Master examined the machine, listened to it, and
eventually pulled out a worn piece of chalk and made a small X on the
side of the machine. He informed the technician that there was a loose
wire that needed repair at that very spot.  The technician opened the
machine and tightened the loose wire, thus fixing the problem. When
the Master's invoice arrived for $10,000, the irate CEO wrote back
demanding a breakdown for this ridiculously high charge for a simple
chalk mark!  The Master responded with another invoice, showing a $1
cost for the chalk to make the mark, and $9,999 for knowing where to
put it.

To us, this is a story about wisdom: that a single, carefully
considered adjustment can have gigantic effects.  Ben tries to use
this technique when managing people.  He imagines his team as flying
around in a great blimp, headed slowly and surely in a certain
direction.  Instead of micromanaging and trying to make continuous
course corrections, he spends most of his week carefully watching and
listening.  At the end of the week he makes a small chalk mark in a
precise location on the blimp, then gives a small but critical
"tap" to adjust the course.
****

Sometimes your team already has consensus about what you need to do,
but they hit a roadblock and get stuck. This could be a technical or
organizational roadblock, but jumping in to help the team get
moving again
is a common leadership technique. There are some roadblocks that,
while virtually impossible for your team members to get past, will be
easy for you to handle, and helping your team to understand that
you're glad (and able) to help out with these roadblocks is
valuable.

One time Fitz's team spent several weeks trying to work past an
obstacle with his company's legal department. When they finally
reached their wits' end and came to Fitz with the problem, he had it
solved in less than two hours because he knew the right person to
contact. Another time Ben's team needed some server resources and just
couldn't get them allocated. Fortunately, Ben was in communication
with other teams across the company and managed to get the team
exactly what they needed that very afternoon. Yet another time one of
the engineers on Fitz's team was having trouble with an arcane bit of
Java code, and while Fitz wasn't a Java expert, he was able to connect
the engineer to another engineer who knew exactly what the problem
was. You don't have to know all the answers to help remove roadblocks,
but it usually helps to know the people who do. __In many cases,
knowing the right person is more valuable than knowing the right
answer__.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc13")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc12")))

[[failure_is_an_option]]
==== Failure Is an Option

((("failure","as an option")))((("patterns, leadership","failure as an option")))Another way to catalyze your team is to make them feel safe and secure
so that they can take greater risks. Risk ((("risks","to catalyze team")))is a fascinating thing—most humans are __terrible__ at
evaluating risk, and most companies try to avoid risk at all costs. As
a result of this, the usual modus operandi is to work conservatively
and focus on smaller successes even when taking a bigger risk might
mean exponentially greater success. A common saying at Google is that
if you try to achieve an impossible goal, there's a good chance you'll
fail, but if you fail trying to achieve the impossible, you'll most
likely accomplish way more than you would have accomplished had you
merely attempted something you knew you could complete. A good way to
build a culture where risk taking is
accepted is to let your team __know__ it's OK to fail.

((("learning","failure as source of")))So let's get that out of the way: it's OK to fail. In fact, we like to
think of failure as a way of learning a lot really quickly (providing
that you're not repeatedly failing at the same thing). In addition,
it's important to see failure as an opportunity to learn and not to
point fingers or assign blame. Failing fast is good, because there's
not a lot ((("Savoia, Alberto")))at stake.footnote:[See Alberto Savoia's talk, http://bit.ly/pretotyping_manifesto["The Pretotyping Manifesto"].] Failing slowly can also teach a valuable
lesson, but it is more painful because more is at risk and more can be
lost (usually engineering time). Failing in a manner that affects your
customers is probably the least desirable failure that we encounter,
and one where we have the greatest amount of structure in place to
learn from failures. As mentioned earlier, every time there is a
production failure at Google, they perform a postmortem. This
procedure is a way to document the events that led to the actual
failure and to develop a series of steps that will prevent it from
happening in the future. This is not an opportunity to point fingers,
nor is it intended to introduce unnecessary bureaucratic checks; the goal is rather to focus strongly on the core of the problem and fix it once
and for all. It's very difficult, but quite effective (and
pass:[<span class="keep-together">cathartic</span>]!).

Individual successes and failures are a bit different. It's one thing
to laud individual successes, but looking to assign individual blame
in the case of failure is a great way to divide a team and discourage
risk taking across the board. It's
OK to fail, but fail as a team and learn from your failures. If an
individual succeeds, praise him in front of the team. If an individual
fails, give constructive criticism in
private.footnote:[Public criticism of
an individual is rarely necessary, and most often is just mean or
cruel. You can be sure the rest of the team already knows when an
individual has failed, so there's no need to rub it in.] Whatever the
case, take advantage of the opportunity and apply a liberal helping of
HRT to help your team to learn from their failures.

[[be_a_teacher_and_a_mentor]]
==== Be a Teacher and a Mentor

((("mentors, leaders as")))((("patterns, leadership","mentoring")))((("patterns, leadership","teaching")))((("teachers, leaders as")))One of the hardest things to do as a team leader is to watch a more
junior-level team member spend three hours working on something you
__know__ you can knock out in 20 minutes. Teaching people and giving
them a chance to learn on their own can be incredibly difficult at
first, but it's a vital component of effective leadership. This is
especially important for new hires who, in addition to learning your
team's technology and code base, are learning your team's culture and
the appropriate level of responsibility to assume.

Much like the role of manager, most people don't apply for the role of
mentor—they usually become one when a team lead is looking for someone
to mentor a new team member. It doesn't take a lot of formal education
or preparation to be a mentor; in fact, you primarily need three
things: experience with your team's processes and systems, the ability
to explain things to someone else, and the ability to gauge how much
help your mentee needs. The last thing is probably the most
important—giving your mentee enough information is what you're
supposed to be doing, but if you overexplain things or ramble on
endlessly, your mentee will probably tune you out rather than politely
tell you she got it.

[[set_clear_goals]]
==== Set Clear Goals

((("goals, setting clear")))((("patterns, leadership","setting clear goals")))This is one of those patterns that, as obvious as it sounds, is solidly
ignored by an enormous number of leaders. If
you're going to get your team moving rapidly in one direction, you
need to make sure they all understand and agree on what the direction
is. Imagine your product is a big truck (and not a series of
tubes). Each team member has in his hand a rope tied to the front of
the truck, and as he works on the product, he'll pull the truck in
his own direction. If your intention is to pull the truck (or
product) northbound as quickly as possible, you can't have team
members pulling every which way—you want them all pulling the truck
north.


[[image_no_caption-id020]]
image::images/dbtm_03in06.png[]

The easiest way to set a clear ((("mission statements")))goal and get your team pulling the
product in the same direction is to create a concise mission statement
for the team (see the section <<the_mission_statementmdashno_really>>
in <<building_an_awesome_team_culture>> for more information about
mission
statements). Once you've helped the team define their direction and
goals, you can step back and give them more autonomy, periodically
checking in to make sure they're still on the right track. This not
only frees up your time to handle other leadership tasks, but it also
__drastically increases the efficiency of your team__. Teams can (and do) succeed
without clear goals, but they typically waste a great deal of energy
as each team member pulls the product in a slightly different
direction. This frustrates you, slows progress for the team, and
forces you to use more and more of your own energy to correct the
course.

[[be_honest]]
==== Be Honest

((("honesty, leadership and")))((("patterns, leadership","honesty")))This doesn't mean we're assuming you are lying to your team, but it
merits a mention because you'll inevitably find yourself in a position
where you can't tell your team something or, even worse, you have to
tell them something they don't want to hear. A former manager of
Fitz's would tell new team members, "I won't lie to you, but I will
tell you when I can't tell you something or if I just don't know."

If a team member approaches you about something you can't share with
her, it's OK to just tell her you know the answer but can't tell
her. Even more common is when a team member asks you something you
don't know the answer to: you can tell her you don't know. This is
another one of those things that seems blindingly obvious when you
read it, but many people move to a manager role and feel that if they
don't know the answer to something it proves they're weak or out of
touch. In reality, the only thing it proves is that they're human.

Giving hard feedback((("feedback","negative"))) is…well,
__hard__. The first time you have to tell one of your reports that he
made a mistake or didn't do his job as well as was expected of him can
be incredibly stressful. ((("compliment sandwich")))Most management texts advise that you use the
"compliment sandwich" to soften the blow when
delivering hard feedback. A compliment sandwich looks
something like this:

__"You're a solid member of the team and one of our smartest
engineers. That being said, your code is incredibly convoluted and
almost impossible for anyone else on the team to understand. But
you've got great potential and a wicked cool neckbeard."__

((("constructive criticism")))Sure, this softens the blow, but with this sort of beating around the
bush most people will walk out of this meeting only thinking, "Sweet!
I've got a wicked cool beard!" We __strongly__ advise against using
the compliment sandwich, not because we think you should be
unnecessarily cruel or harsh, but __because most people won't hear the
critical message__, which is that something needs to change. It's
possible to employ HRT here: be kind and empathetic when delivering
constructive criticism without resorting to the compliment
sandwich. In fact, kindness and empathy are __critical__ if you want
the recipient to hear the criticism and not immediately go on the
defensive.


[[image_no_caption-id021]]
image::images/dbtm_03in07.png[]

Years ago, Fitz picked up a team member, Tim, from another manager who
insisted that Tim was impossible to work with. He told Fitz that Tim
never responded to feedback or criticism and instead just kept doing the same
things he'd been told he shouldn't do. Fitz sat in on a few of the
manager's meetings with Tim to watch the interaction between the
manager and Tim, and he noticed that the manager made extensive use of
the compliment sandwich so
as not to hurt Tim's feelings. When Fitz took Tim on his team, he sat
down with him and very clearly explained that Tim needed to make some
changes to work more effectively with the team. Fitz didn't give Tim
any compliments or candy-coat the issue, but just as importantly, Fitz
wasn't mean—he just laid out the facts as he saw them based on Tim's
performance with the previous team. Lo and behold, within a matter of
weeks (and after a few more "refresher" meetings), Tim's performance
improved dramatically. Tim just needed very clear feedback and pass:[<span class="keep-together">direction</span>].

When you're providing direct feedback or criticism, your delivery is key to
making sure your message is heard and not deflected. If you put the
recipient on the defensive, he's not going to be thinking of how he
can change, but rather how he can argue with you to show you you're
wrong. Ben once managed an engineer we'll call Dean. Dean had
extremely strong opinions and would argue with the rest of the team
about __anything__. It could be something as big as the team's mission
or as small as the placement of a widget on a web page; Dean would
argue with the same conviction and vehemence either way, and he
refused to let anything slide. After months of this behavior, Ben met
with Dean to explain to him that he was being too combative. Now, if Ben had just
said, "Dean, stop being such a jerk," you can be pretty sure Dean would have disregarded it entirely. Ben
thought hard about how he could get Dean to understand how his actions
were adversely affecting the team, and he came up with the following
metaphor:

[quote]
____

Every time a decision is made, it's like a train coming through
town—when you jump in front of the train to stop it you slow the train
down and potentially annoy the engineer driving the train. A new train
comes by every 15 minutes, and if you jump in front of every train,
not only do you spend a lot of your time stopping trains, but
eventually one of the engineers driving the train is going to get mad
enough to run right over you. So, while it's OK to jump in front of
some trains, pick and choose the ones you want to stop to make sure
you're only stopping the trains that really matter.
____


This anecdote not only injected a bit of humor into the situation, but
also made it easier for Ben and Dean to discuss the effect that Dean's
"train stopping" was having on the team
in addition to the energy Dean was spending on
it.

[[track_happiness]]
==== Track Happiness

((("happiness, tracking", id="ixch03asciidoc14", range="startofrange")))((("patterns, leadership","tracking happiness", id="ixch03asciidoc15", range="startofrange")))((("tracking happiness", id="ixch03asciidoc16", range="startofrange")))As a leader, one way you can make your team more productive (and less
likely to leave) in the long term is to take some time to gauge their happiness. The best
leaders we've worked with have all been
amateur psychologists, looking in on their team members' welfare from
time to time, making sure they get recognition for what they do, and
trying to make certain they are happy with their work. One leader we
know makes a spreadsheet of all the grungy, thankless tasks that need
to be done and makes certain these tasks are evenly spread across the
team. Another leader watches the hours his team is working and uses
comp time and fun team outings to avoid burnout and exhaustion. Yet
another leader starts one-on-one sessions with his team members by
dealing with their technical issues as a way to break the ice, and
then takes some time to make sure each engineer has everything he
needs to get his work done. After they've warmed up, he talks to the
engineer for a bit about how he's enjoying the work he's doing and
what he's looking forward to next.

One of the most valuable tools in tracking your team's happiness is, at the end
of each one-on-one meeting, to ask the team member, "What do you need?" This simple question is a great way to wrap up and make
sure each team member has what he needs to be productive and happy,
although you may need to carefully probe a bit to get details. If you
ask this every time you have a one-on-one, you'll find that eventually
your team will remember this and sometimes even come to you with a
laundry list of things they need to make their job better.

.The Unexpected Question
****
((("Schmidt, Eric")))Shortly after Fitz started at Google he had his first meeting with
then-CEO Eric Schmidt, and at the end Eric asked
Fitz, "Is there anything you need?" Fitz, who had prepared a million
defensive responses to hard questions or challenges, was __completely__
unprepared for this. So he sat there dumbstruck and staring. But you
can be sure Fitz had something ready the next time he was asked that
question!
****

It can also be worthwhile to pay some attention to your team's
happiness __outside__ the office. Be wary of assuming that people have no life outside of work—having
unrealistic expectations
about the amount of time people can put into their work will cause
people to lose respect for you, or worse, to burn out. We're not
advocating that you pry into your team members' personal lives, but
being sensitive to personal situations that your team members are
going through can give you a lot of insight into why they may be more
or less productive at any given time. Giving a little extra slack to a
team member who is having a tough time at home now can make him a lot
more willing to put in longer hours when your team has a tight
deadline to hit later.

A big part of tracking your team members' happiness is
tracking their careers. If you ask a team member where she sees her
career in five years, most of the time you'll get a shrug and a blank
look. When put on the spot, most people won't say much about this, but
there are usually a few things that everyone would like to do in the
next five years: get promoted, learn something new, launch something
important, and work with smart
people. Regardless of whether they verbalize this, most people are
thinking about it. If you're going to be an effective leader, you
should be thinking about how you can help make all those things happen
and let your team know you're thinking about this. The most important
part of this is to take these implicit goals and make them
__explicit__ so that when you're giving career advice you have a real
set of metrics on which to evaluate situations and opportunities.

Tracking happiness comes down to not just monitoring
careers, but also giving your team members opportunities to improve
themselves, get recognized for the work they do, and have a little fun
along the way.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc16")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc15")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc14")))

[[other_tips_and_tricks]]
==== Other Tips and Tricks

((("delegation")))__Delegate, ((("patterns, leadership","various tips and tricks", id="ixch03asciidoc17", range="startofrange")))but get your hands dirty__. When moving from an individual
contributor role to a leadership role, achieving a balance is one of
the hardest things to do: initially, you're inclined to do all of the
work yourself, and after being in a leadership role for a long time,
it's easy to get into the habit of doing __none__ of the work
yourself. If you're new to a leadership role, you probably need to
work hard to delegate work to other engineers on your team, even if it
will take them a lot longer than you to accomplish that work. Not only
is this one way for you to maintain your sanity, but also it's how the
rest of your team will learn. If you've been leading teams for a while
or if you pick up a new team, one of the easiest ways to gain the
team's respect and get up to speed on what they're doing is to get
your hands dirty—usually by taking on a grungy task no one else wants
to do. You can have a résumé and a list of achievements a mile long,
but nothing lets a team know how skillful and dedicated (and humble)
you are like jumping in and actually doing some hard
work.

((("replacing yourself")))__Seek to replace yourself__. Unless you want to keep doing the exact
same job for the rest of your career, seek to replace yourself. This
starts, as we mentioned earlier, with the hiring process: if you want
a member of your team to replace you, you need to hire people capable
of replacing you, which we usually sum up by saying you need to "hire
people smarter than you." Once you have team members capable of doing
your job, you need to give them opportunities to take on more
responsibilities or occasionally lead the team. If you do this, you'll
quickly see who has the most aptitude to lead as well as who __wants__
to lead the team. Remember that some people prefer to just be
high-performing individual contributors, and that's OK. We've always
been amazed at companies that take their best engineers and—against
their wishes—throw these engineers into management roles. This usually
subtracts a great engineer from your team and adds a subpar manager.

((("waves, making")))__Know when to make waves__. You will (inevitably and frequently) have
difficult situations crop up where every cell in your body is
screaming at you to do nothing about it. It may be the engineer on
your team whose technical chops aren't up to par. It may be the person
who jumps in front of every train. It may be the unmotivated employee
who is working 30 hours a week. "Just wait a bit and it will get
better," you'll tell yourself. "It will work itself out," you'll
rationalize. Don't fall into this trap—these are the situations where
you __need__ to make the biggest waves and you need to make them
now. Rarely will these problems work themselves out, and the longer
you wait to address them, the more they'll adversely affect the rest
of the team and the more they'll keep you up at night thinking about
them. By waiting, you're only delaying the inevitable and causing
untold damage in the process. So act, and act quickly.

((("chaos")))__Shield your team from chaos__. When you step into a leadership role,
the first thing you'll usually discover is that outside your team is a
world of chaos and uncertainty (or even insanity) that you never saw
when you were an individual contributor. When Fitz first became a
manager back in the 1990s (before going back to being an individual
contributor) he was taken aback by the sheer volume of uncertainty and
organizational chaos that was happening in his company. He asked
another manager what had caused this sudden rockiness in the otherwise
calm company, and the other manager laughed hysterically at Fitz's
naïveté: the chaos had always been present, but Fitz's previous
manager had shielded Fitz and the rest of the team from it.

((("air cover, for your team")))__Give your team air cover__. While it's important that you keep your
team informed about what's going on "above" them in the company, it's
just as important that you defend them from a lot of the uncertainty
and frivolous demands that may be imposed upon you from outside your
team. Share as much information as you can with your team, but don't
distract them with organizational craziness that is extremely unlikely
to ever actually affect them.

((("feedback","positive")))((("positive feedback")))__Let your team know when they're doing well__. Many new team leads
can get so caught up in dealing with the shortcomings of their team
members that they neglect to provide positive feedback often
enough. Just as you let someone know when he screws up, be sure to let
him know when he does well, and be sure to let him (and the rest of
the team) know when he knocks one out of the
park.

Lastly, here's something the best leaders
know and use often when they have adventurous team members who want to
try new things often: it's easy to say "yes" if it's easy to undo
something. If you have a team member who wants to take a day or two to
try using a new tool or library that could speed up your product (and
you're not on a tight deadline), it's easy to say, "Sure, give it a
shot." If, on the other hand, she wants to do something like launch a
product that you're going to have to support for the next 10 years,
you'll likely want to give it a bit more thought. Really good leaders
have a good sense for when something can be undone.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc17")))

[[imposter_phenomenon]]
.Imposter Phenomenon
****

((("imposter phenomenon")))((("leaders","and imposter phenomenon")))Much has been written about((("Clance, Pauline Rose"))) the so-called "imposter syndrome" or "imposter
phenomenon,"footnote:[ First documented by
Dr. Pauline Rose Clance, http://paulineroseclance.com/impostor_phenomenon.html.] which
according to Wikipedia is a __"psychological phenomenon in which
people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite
external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain
convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they
have achieved."__

We prefer the "phenomenon" nomenclature because, even though this may
make you feel like a fraud who will be discovered at any time, the imposter
phenomenon often drives you to work much harder and achieve goals that
you might never have achieved otherwise.

This problem is extremely common in people new to management,
especially those thrust into leadership positions (official or not) by
necessity.  The phenomenon is so widespread that we almost always get
asked about it after our talks.  __"I don't actually know what I'm
doing,"__ people will say, __"so what can I do to stop feeling like a
phony?"__ Our answer is that everyone feels like a phony at some point
in their career; one could even argue that a little bit of insecurity
makes us work harder and helps improve our success.

Ben likes to share the story of his parents' marriage. The night
before they got married, they both got cold feet and admitted to each
other that they had made a Terrible Mistake--but that it was clearly
far too late to call off the wedding.  So they made a pact to "fake
it" for the wedding, play the stage role of happy newlyweds, and then
maybe call things off a few days later.  A couple of weeks later, they
decided to try another month of marriage.  And then the month after
that, and the month after that.  Eventually it became a running joke
in their marriage.  Every year on their anniversary they would say,
"Let's give this trial another year, eh?"

Whatever sort of leadership you're involved in, the same "fake it till
you make it" technique tends to work very well.  When Ben first got
asked to manage a large team, a similar script went through his mind:
__"You want me to own this project?  That's crazy, but OK, I guess I'll
pretend to be a leader for a while."__ Then every year at
performance-review time, he'd look back at his success and and say,
__"Yeah, I guess I'll keep pretending a bit longer—seems to be going
well!"__(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc7")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc6")))

=== People Are Like Plants

((("leaders","and treating people like plants", id="ixch03asciidoc18", range="startofrange")))((("needs, of individual team members", id="ixch03asciidoc19", range="startofrange")))((("plants, people's similarity to", id="ixch03asciidoc20", range="startofrange")))Fitz's wife is the youngest of six children, and her mother was faced
with the difficult task of figuring out how to raise six __very
different__ children, each of whom needed different things. Fitz asked
his mother-in-law how she managed this (see what we did there?), and
she responded that kids are like plants: some are like cactuses and
need little water but lots of sunshine, others are like African
violets and need diffuse light and moist soil, and still others are
like tomatoes and will truly excel if you give them a little
fertilizer. If you have six kids and give each one the same amount of
water, light, and fertilizer, they'll all get equal treatment, but the
odds are good that __none__ of them will get what they actually
__need__.


[[image_no_caption-id023]]
image::images/dbtm_03in09.png[]

And so your team members are also like plants: some need more light,
and some need more water (and some need more bullshit, er,
fertilizer). It's your job as their leader to figure out who needs
what and to then give it to them.

Take a look at this matrix:


[[image_no_caption-id024]]
image::images/dbtm_03in10.png[]

To get all of your team members into the sweet spot, you need to
motivate the ones who fall into the "In a rut" portion of the matrix,
and provide stronger direction to those who are in the "Look!
Squirrel!" portion. Of course, those who are "adrift" need both
motivation __and__ direction. So, instead of
water and sunlight, you need to provide team members with a
combination of motivation and direction to make them happy and
productive. And you don't want to give them too much of either—because
if they don't need motivation or direction and you try giving it to
them, you're just going to annoy them.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc20")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc19")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc18")))

Giving direction is fairly straightforward—it requires a basic
understanding of what needs to be done, some simple organizational
skills, and enough coordination to break it down into manageable
tasks. With those tools in hand you can provide enough guidance for an
engineer in need of directional help (OK, there's more to it, but we
covered a lot of that earlier in the chapter). Motivation, however, is
a bit more sophisticated and merits some explanation.

[[intrinsic_versus_extrinsic_motivation]]
=== Intrinsic Versus Extrinsic Motivation

((("extrinsic motivation")))((("intrinsic motivation")))((("leaders","intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation")))((("motivation, intrinsic vs. extrinsic")))There are two types of motivation: extrinsic, which originates from outside((("Drive (Pink)")))((("Pink, Dan"))) forces
(such as monetary compensation), and intrinsic, which comes from
within. In his book __Drive__,footnote:[As we
mentioned earlier in this chapter, see also Dan's fantastic TED talk
on this subject.] Dan Pink explains that the
way to make people the happiest and most productive isn't to motivate
them extrinsically (e.g., throw piles of cash at them), but rather to
work to increase their __intrinsic__ motivation. Dan claims you can
increase intrinsic motivation by giving people three
things: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.footnote:[This
assumes that the people in question are being paid well enough that
income is not a source of stress.]

A person has __autonomy__ when she has the ability to act on her own
without someone micromanaging her.footnote:[Of
course, this assumes that you have people on your team who don't need
micromanagement.] With autonomous employees, you might give them the
general direction in which they need to take the product, but leave it
up to them to decide how to get there. This helps with motivation not
only because they have a closer relationship with the product (and
likely know better than you how to build it), but also because it
gives them a much greater sense of ownership of the product. The
bigger their stake is in the success of the product, the greater their
interest is in seeing it succeed.

__Mastery__ in its((("mastery"))) basest form simply means you need to give someone
the opportunity to learn new skills and improve existing
skills. Giving ample opportunities for mastery not only helps to
motivate people, but also makes them better over time, which makes for
stronger teams.footnote:[Of course, it also means
they're more valuable and marketable employees, so it's easier for
them to pick up and leave you if they're not enjoying their work. See
the pattern in <<track_happiness>>.] An
employee's skills are like the blade of a knife: you may spend tens of
thousands of dollars to find people with the sharpest skills for your
team, but if you "use" that knife for years without sharpening it, you
will wind up with a dull knife that is inefficient, and in some cases
useless. Ample opportunities for team members to learn new things and
master their craft will keep them sharp, efficient, and
effective.

Of course, all the autonomy and mastery in the world isn't going to
help motivate someone if she's doing work for no reason at all, which
is why you need to give her work __purpose__. Many people work on
products that have great significance, but they are kept at arm's
length from the positive effects their products may have on their
company, their customers, or even the world. Even in cases where the
product may have a much smaller impact, you can motivate your team by
seeking the reason for their efforts and making this reason clear to
them. If you can help them to see this purpose in their work, you'll
see a tremendous increase in their motivation and
productivity.footnote:[link:$$http://bit.ly/task_significance$$[]] One manager we know keeps a close eye on the
email feedback the company gets for its product (one of the
"smaller-impact" products), and whenever she sees a message from a
customer talking about how the company's product has helped the
customer personally or helped the customer's business, she immediately
forwards it to the engineering team. This not only motivates the team,
but also frequently inspires them to think about ways they can make
their product even better.

[[final_thoughts]]
=== Final Thoughts

Regardless of whether you ever intend to lead a team, we hope this
chapter has helped you understand what it takes to be a good team
leader and dispelled some of the myths about what a leader does for a
team. Even if you're resolute in your commitment to never be a leader,
it's good to be familiar with the concepts laid out in this chapter
because they can help you understand why the leader of __your__ team
does what she does, regardless of whether she's good at her job or
terrible at it. Take a moment to look at your team and see which of
these patterns and antipatterns your team leader applies to make your
team succeed (or fail), and you'll have a more concrete understanding
of what makes your team tick.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch03asciidoc0")))

But understanding the team and leader you work with every day is only
one aspect of working with other people—crossing paths with someone
outside your team can be even more challenging, especially if this
person is out to sabotage your team. We call these "poisonous people,"
and we discuss them in the following chapter.
