== Dealing with Poisonous People

((("poisonous people", id="ixch04asciidoc0", range="startofrange")))As the opening quote of our book suggests, the hardest part of
creative work is __people__.

Up until now, we've taken an introspective approach. We began with an
examination of your own private behaviors and how to focus them on the
principles of humility, respect, and trust (HRT). We then explored
ways to build a communicative team culture around these concepts. In
the preceding chapter, we explained how to mold yourself into an
effective leader of such a team, should the need arise.

In the second half of this book we're going to shift gears and start
looking outward. How does your team interact with people __outside__
your immediate group? There are almost always folks wishing to join or
collaborate with your team. There are issues in dealing with the
politics of your larger organization. And, of course, you need to have
a plan for dealing with the most important outsiders of all: the users
of your software!

In this chapter, we'll discuss the importance of preventing
destructive outsiders from trashing the cooperative culture your team
has worked hard to build. Perhaps more importantly, we'll also talk
about how to deal with poisonous people already on your team.

[[defining_poisonous]]
=== Defining "Poisonous"

((("poisonous people","defined")))We've already reviewed the importance of building a solid,
communicative team culture. We spent most of the time talking about
what a good culture should include: things like consensus-based
development, high-quality code, code reviews, and an environment where
people feel comfortable enough to try new things and to fail
fast.

Just as important is the need to talk about what your culture should
__not__ include. If you're trying to build a highly efficient,
fast-moving team, it's important to focus on what you __don't__
want. While brilliant engineers can make your team faster and more
efficient, certain antibehaviors can make your team slower and less
efficient, and make your company a less comfortable place to work—and
eventually erode the bonds that hold the team together.

When we first began speaking about the social challenges of software
development, we came up with a presentation titled "How to Deal with
Bad Eggs." A conference chair suggested we rename the talk to "How
Projects Survive Poisonous People," with the hope that a more
sensational title would draw a bigger audience. And he was right: we
gave the presentation over and over at different conferences to
standing-room-only crowds. It's not just the negativity of a word like
__poisonous__ that attracted people, but the fact that everyone seems
to have some sort of personal experience in dealing with irritating
people. The talks would almost always turn into a group therapy
session, with audience members swapping war stories and seeking
advice.

But there's a danger here. In general, it's not healthy to spend your
time stewing in an ocean of negativity—it tends to eat you up and can
create more conflicts in the long run.footnote:[Yoda
would probably have something to say here about avoiding the Dark
Side.] The term __poisonous person__ is a nasty label and
automatically creates a dividing line between "us" (the good guys) and
"them" (those nasty jerks). There's a better way to think about the
problem. Instead of running your((("negative behaviors"))) team as an elite fraternity with a
mission to "repel mean people," it's healthier to create a culture
that simply refuses to tolerate certain negative behaviors. It's the
__behaviors__ you want to filter out, not particular individuals. It's
naïve to think of individuals as purely good or bad; it's more
constructive and practical to identify and reprimand the intolerable
behaviors.

For now, we'll continue to use the term __poisonous person__ as a
simplifying piece of rhetoric, one that refers to a person who isn't
behaving well. In practice, though, this is not a term you'd want to
use in everyday conversations!

[[fortifying_your_team]]
=== Fortifying Your Team

((("poisonous people","fortifying your team against", id="ixch04asciidoc1", range="startofrange")))((("team building","fortifying against poisonous people", id="ixch04asciidoc2", range="startofrange")))Recall our yeast metaphor: how a team culture grows from an important
starter culture. The biggest single influence
on the long-term culture of your team is the team you start with, and
if the founding team doesn't establish a strong enough culture,
strains of other cultures will overgrow it. If your starter team
builds a strong sense of acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, these
expectations will endure.

The two of us have spent a lot of time in the world of open source
projects, and our own experiences jibe with this idea pretty strongly.

The project we were most involved with—Subversion—was started by a
very small group of people. They had a lot of humility and naturally
trusted and respected one another. After 15-plus years, the project
has gone through at least three or four generations of participants
(the founders are mostly gone), and yet the same culture
persists—everyone is kind, is polite, and expects that same behavior
from everyone else. The culture perpetuates not just because of high
standards, but because cultures tend to((("self-selection"))) be __self-selecting__. Nice
people tend to be attracted to existing nice
communities.

Self-selection can easily work in the other direction as well. When a
team is started by a group of angry jerks, the effort tends to attract
more and more individuals of the same sort. Certain projects that we
won't mention((("team efficiency"))) here (like the Linux kernel community) are keen examples
of this—full of endless bickering and chest thumping. Yes, the team
may get a lot of work done, but the overall __efficiency__ of its
operation is doubtful. How much more work would get done if so much
energy weren't being spent on personal attacks? How much potential
contribution is lost because polite people are being driven away at
the front door?


[[image_no_caption-id025]]
image::images/dbtm_04in01.png[]

We bring up this topic again because you need to understand what's at
stake: poisonous
people are a direct threat to your high-functioning team. If you allow
bad behaviors to persist, not only does your productivity decrease,
but you may also find your culture slowly changing for the worse. The
best defense is to fortify your culture through a strong set of best
practices and procedures. We covered them in
<<building_an_awesome_team_culture>>, but here's a quick refresher:


* Have a visible mission statement, to keep you focused on both your
  goals and nongoals.


* Establish proper etiquette around email
  discussions. Keep archives, get newcomers to read them, and prevent
  filibustering by noisy minorities.


* Document all history: not just code history, but also design
  decisions, important bug fixes, and prior mistakes.


* Collaborate effectively. Use version control, keep code changes
  small and reviewable, and spread the "bus factor"
  around to prevent territoriality.


* Have clear policies and procedures around fixing bugs, testing, and releasing software.


* Streamline the barrier to entry for newcomers.


* Rely on consensus-based decisions, but also have a fallback process
  for resolving conflicts when consensus can't be reached.

The bottom line is that the more ingrained these best practices are,
the more intolerant of poisonous behavior your community will be. When
troublemakers arrive, you'll be ready.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch04asciidoc2")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch04asciidoc1")))

[[identifying_the_threat]]
=== Identifying the Threat

((("poisonous people","identifying threat of", id="ixch04asciidoc3", range="startofrange")))((("teams","threats posed by poisonous people", id="ixch04asciidoc4", range="startofrange")))((("threats, identifying", id="ixch04asciidoc5", range="startofrange")))If you're going to defend your team against poisonous people, the first thing you need to
do is to understand exactly what constitutes a threat and when you
should become concerned.

What's specifically at risk is your team's __attention__ and
__focus__.

Attention ((("focus")))and focus are the scarcest resources you have. The bigger
the team, the more capacity the team has to focus on building things
and solving interesting problems—but it's always a finite amount. If
you don't actively protect these things, it's easy for poisonous
people to disrupt your team's flow. Your team ends up bickering,
distracted, and emotionally drained. Everyone ends up spending all
their attention and focus on things __other__ than creating a great
pass:[<span class="keep-together">product</span>].

[[image_no_caption-id026]]
image::images/dbtm_04in02.png[]

Meanwhile, one has to wonder: what does a poisonous person look like?
To defend yourself, you need to know what to look out
for.

In our experiences, it's rare to find people who are deliberately
being malicious (i.e., are trying to be jerks on purpose). We call
such people "trolls" and typically ignore them. Most
people who behave badly, however, either don't realize it or simply
don't care. It's more an issue of ignorance or apathy, rather than
malice. Most of the bad
behaviors boil down to a simple lack of HRT.

Here are some classic signals and patterns to watch for. Whenever we
see these patterns, we talk about "flipping the bozo bit" on the person—that is, we make a mental note that the
person is consistently exhibiting poisonous behaviors and that we should be
extremely careful in dealing with her.

[[not_respecting_other_peoples_time]]
==== Lack of Respect for Other People's Time

((("time, wasting")))There are certain people out there who simply are unable to figure out
what's going on in a project. Their damage is most often in the form
of wasting the team's time. Rather than spending a few minutes of
their own time reading fundamental project documentation, mission
statements, FAQs, or the latest email discussion threads, they
repeatedly distract the entire team with questions about things they
could easily figure out on their own.

In the Subversion project, we once had a participant who decided to
use the main developer discussion forum as a sounding board for his
daily stream of consciousness. Charlie made no actual code
contribution. Instead, every two or three hours, he'd send out his
latest daydreams and brainstorms. There would inevitably be multiple
responses explaining why his ideas were incorrect, impossible, already
in progress, previously discussed, and/or already documented. To make
things worse, Charlie even started answering questions from drive-by
users, and answering them __incorrectly__. Core contributors had to
repeatedly correct his replies. It took us quite a while to realize
that this affable, enthusiastic participant was in fact poisonous and draining our collective energy.
Later in this chapter we'll talk about how we dealt with the
situation.

[[ego]]
==== Ego

((("ego","of poisonous people")))Perhaps __ego__ isn't the perfect word here, but we're using the term
to describe anyone who is incapable of accepting a consensus decision,
listening to or respecting other points of view, or reaching compromises. This
person will typically reopen discussions that have been long settled
(and documented in email archives) because she wasn't around to
participate in the decision. The person won't read or think about the
history at all, demanding that the debate be replayed just for her
sake. She will often make sweeping claims about the project's success,
claiming that doom is imminent unless she gets her way.

The Subversion project had a notable episode in which an intelligent
programmer showed up on the email list one day and declared that the
entire product was ill-designed. He had seen the light, had radical
ideas about how things should work, and insisted that the entire
project start over from scratch. He even helpfully volunteered to lead
the reboot himself. Without his leadership, he proclaimed that
complete failure was looming just around the
corner.

An entire week was wasted while the project founders endlessly argued
with this person and defended their original design decisions. A huge
amount of attention and focus was lost. It became clear that this
person wasn't willing to compromise or integrate any of his ideas into
the current product, and the product (which was already in beta and
being used in the wild) wasn't about to start over. At some point we
simply had to walk away from the debate and get back on
track. Ironically, years later, this person's predictions turned out
to be correct on many levels, but that didn't stop Subversion from
becoming wildly successful anyway—at least in corporate software
development. The point here isn't about who is right or wrong, but
whether a disagreement is guaranteed to come to a conclusion and
whether it's worthwhile to keep a debate going. Never stop asking
yourself those sorts of questions; at some point you need to decide
when it's time to cut your losses and move on.

[[Entitlement]]
==== Entitlement

((("entitlement")))Anytime you have a visitor who __demands__ that something be done,
your alarm should go off. Something is wrong with a person who puts
all her energy into complaining about the inadequacies of the
software but is unwilling to directly contribute in any
way.

This((("Google Project Hosting service"))) sense of entitlement sometimes bleeds into troll-like
behavior. While running Google's Project Hosting service, we once had
a project owner ask us to ban a user for obscene behavior. The open
source project, a video game emulator, didn't work properly for his
favorite video game. The user started by filing a rather rude bug in
the issue tracker. The project developers politely explained why the
game didn't work yet, and why it was unlikely to be fixed for a good
while. This answer was unacceptable to the user, who began to harass
the developers daily. He would open bug after bug with the same
complaint. He started adding comments to __other__ bugs saying what
"idiots" the developers were for refusing to fix his problem. His
language became increasingly obscene over time, despite repeated
warnings from the developers and Google administrators. Regardless of
all our efforts to eliminate his destructive behavior, he steadfastly
refused to change, so we were eventually forced—as a last resort—to
ban him entirely.

[[immature_or_confusing_communication]]
==== Immature or Confusing Communication

((("communication","confusing")))((("communication","immature")))((("confusing communication")))((("immature communication")))The person doesn't use her real name. Instead, you'll see only
childish nicknames like "SuperCamel," "jubjub89," or "SirHacksalot."
To make things worse, often the person will have different nicknames
in different media—one name for email, a different one for instant
messaging, and perhaps a different one for code submissions. In
extreme cases, you'll see these people communicating in lol-speak,
1337speak, ALL CAPS, or with excessive
punctuation!??!1!!1!!

[[paranoia]]
==== Paranoia

((("paranoia")))As seen in the earlier example, sometimes an inappropriate sense of entitlement
leads directly into open hostility toward a project. Many times we see
it escalate into complete paranoia. When an existing
team disagrees with the visitor, the poisonous person will sometimes
start to throw accusations of a "cabal" and conspiracy. It's amusing
to imagine that the project team finds him so important that they'd
go through the effort of conspiring against the visitor. And if you
already have an open and transparent culture of communication (as we
pushed for in <<building_an_awesome_team_culture>>), this makes the
accusation all the more hilarious, since every conversation is already
a public record. The recommendation here is to not even bother
responding to such charges. By the time the poisonous person goes this far over the edge, anything
you say will only dig yourself a deeper hole in his mind, so why
bother saying anything at all? It's time to get back to the important
work of making things.

[[perfectionism]]
==== Perfectionism

((("perfectionists","as threat to team")))On the surface, perfectionists don't seem dangerous at all. Sure,
there may be a touch of odd obsessive-compulsive behavior now and then, but usually
the person is humble, polite, respectful, and a good listener. He
seems stuffed full of happy HRT and good intentions. What's the
problem, then? The problem is the threat of paralysis.

Let's look at a person we've worked with in the past. Patrick was a
brilliant engineer. He had great design chops, wrote high-quality code
and tests, and was easy to get along with. Unfortunately, when it came
time to design new software, he could spend the rest of his life
tweaking and improving his design. He was never satisfied with the
plans and seemingly was never ready to start coding. While he
certainly had good points and excellent insights into the problems we
were trying to solve, the rest of the team ended up becoming immensely
frustrated; it became clear that we were never actually going to write
any code. Several of us on the project deliberated quite a bit on what
to do about this. On the one hand, Patrick was a huge help to our
team. On the other hand, he was preventing us from making forward
progress as a group. Every time we'd begin to code he'd politely veto
and point out potential theoretical problems that could matter in the
distant future. He was paralyzing us without realizing it. We'll talk
about how we resolved this in the next section.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch04asciidoc5")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch04asciidoc4")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch04asciidoc3")))

[[repelling_the_poison]]
=== Repelling the Poison

((("poisonous people","strategies for dealing with", id="ixch04asciidoc6", range="startofrange")))We don't advocate throwing people out of a community just because
they're being antisocial or rude. As we mentioned earlier, it's not
healthy to create a clique focused on "us" (the nice people) versus
"them" (the mean people). In our prior examples we didn't focus on
booting the person, but rather on booting the __behavior__. Make it
clear that bad behaviors will not be tolerated. If, after repeated
warnings, the behavior doesn't change, only then does it makes sense
to consider formal rejection.

Concentrating your effort on removing toxic behavior is often enough
to turn an intelligent (although perhaps socially awkward) person into
a productive member of your team. A few years ago we had a team member
who was an excellent engineer but had an annoying habit of
accidentally insulting teammates. Rather than just ejecting him from
the community, one of us pulled him aside and asked him if he was
aware that his words were alienating people. He seemed somewhat
surprised that this was happening and didn't exactly understand why
his actions were having this effect. But he agreed that it would be
worthwhile to try to temper his actions in the interest of being a
better team member. And everything worked out perfectly. He changed
his behavior, and the problem was resolved. Not every anecdote ends in
exile!

OK, so you've identified a poisonous person. Perhaps there's someone
distracting and draining your team's energy right now. How do you deal
effectively with the situation? Here are some useful strategies.

[[redirect_the_energy_of_perfectionists]]
==== Redirect the Energy of Perfectionists

((("perfectionists","redirecting energy of")))Once a good-enough solution is found for the original problem, point
the perfectionist to a different problem that still needs attention.

In the case of Subversion's perfectionist, this strategy worked
well. Eventually, we reached a point where we took Patrick aside and
said, "OK, we're just going to start working from this design as it
stands now, and see what happens. Hopefully you'll be able to help us
navigate around any problems that crop up down the road." To our
surprise, Patrick was OK with this and instead moved on to a different
subject as the object of his obsession. No feelings were hurt either
way, and Patrick kept contributing to the overall effort.

There's an old saying to not let "the perfect be the enemy of the
good," and in your quest to create a high-performing team, you need to
be just as vigilant about avoiding perfectionism as you are about calling out more
obvious disruptive behaviors.

This trick of redirecting energy
also works on the overly entitled people who spend more time
complaining and criticizing than helping out. It's tempting to respond
to such a person with a standard "patches welcome" remark—the open
source community's euphemistic version of telling someone to put up or
shut up. Instead, try getting him to take an interest in formally
testing the software and pointing out regressions. It allows him to
keep complaining, but in a useful way.

[[dont_feed_the_energy_creature]]
==== Don't Feed the Energy Creature

((("trolls","dangers of responding to")))This is an old adage((("Usenet"))) from Usenet.footnote:[Which may
itself refer to that original __Star Trek__ episode, "Day of the
Dove," in which negative emotions fed an energy creature. Kirk and his
Klingon counterpart Kang ordered their men to stop feeding the energy creature,
and it departed from the __Enterprise__. See, it all comes back to
__Star Trek__.] In particular, this works best against deliberate
trolls—people who are purposely trying to get a rise out of you or
your team. The more you respond, the more the troll feeds off your
energy, and the more time you've wasted. ((("silent treatment")))The simple silent treatment
often works best. Regardless of how much you're dying to deliver that
one-line zinger that'll put him in his place, resist the urge. When
the person realizes nobody's paying attention, he typically loses
interest and just leaves. Note that it often takes quite a bit of
willpower to not respond. Stay strong!


[[image_no_caption-id027]]
image::images/dbtm_04in03.png[]

[[dont_get_overly_emotional]]
==== Don't Get Overly Emotional

((("emotion","when dealing with poisonous people")))Even if the person isn't deliberately trolling, it's all too easy to
get defensive. When somebody accuses you of making a bad design
decision or of conspiracy, or simply wastes your time by asking too
many questions whose answers are obvious, it's easy to get
upset. Remember that your job is to build great things, not to appease
every visitor or repeatedly justify your existence. The stronger your
emotions are, the more likely you are to waste hours or days writing
passionate replies to someone who doesn't deserve such
attention. Choose your battles carefully and keep calm. Carefully decide who's worth
replying to, and who you'll pass:[<span class="keep-together">let be</span>].

[[look_for_facts_in_the_bile]]
==== Look for Facts in the Bile

((("facts, when dealing with poisonous people")))Continuing on with the theme of staying clear of too much emotion, a
corollary is to actively look for facts. If someone is complaining,
listen carefully. Always start by giving the person the benefit of the
doubt, despite the angry or rude language. Does the person have a real
point? Is there something to learn from the person's experience, or is
there an idea worth responding to? Very often the answer is "yes"—that
despite a poisonous person's vitriolic prose, some wisdom really is
buried in there. Always bring the argument back to a technical
pass:[<span class="keep-together">discussion</span>].footnote:[For more on this subject, see
((("Kerth, Norman")))Norman Kerth's "The Retrospective Prime
Directive," in his book __Project Retrospectives__ (Dorset House).]

Our favorite example of this is the day we got a rancorous email from
a well-known leader of the open source community. It was a bug report
of sorts, but on the surface it was more like a rant about the team's
overall intelligence. The post was chock-full of slander and
hyperbole, and seemed intended to inflame the team rather than to get
the bug fixed. One of our team members, however, responded to the
report with just a few specific questions, focusing only on the
bug. The bug reporter replied with more clarification, but still it
was wrapped in over-the-top venom. Our team member continued to
completely ignore the insults, investigated the issue, and replied
with a simple "Thanks for the bug report, I see how to fix the
problem—we'll release a patch soon."

((("calmness, when dealing with poisonous people")))We were immensely proud of the way our team member handled the
situation. Remaining utterly calm and fact-driven only made the
original poster seem like more of a lunatic as the conversation
progressed. By the end of the exchange, the bug reporter had lost all
credibility with his audience and no longer had any interest in
hanging around.

[[repel_trolls_with_niceness]]
==== Repel Trolls with Niceness

((("niceness, repelling trolls with")))((("trolls","repelling with niceness")))To take the preceding approach (of remaining cool-headed and factual)
even further, sometimes it's possible to scare people away just by
being too kind! Here's an actual chat transcript from the Subversion
IRC channel:

sussman: If you need help, then ask.

harry: I want to cvs someone's files. No, I just want to gripe. But
this person is hung up on this thing called Subversion so he has svn
instead of cvs.

sussman: So get an svn client and checkout his sources.

harry: So I go and download this Subversion thing…can you configure
make make install Subversion like you can cvs? Of course not. I blame

[[know_when_to_give_up]]
==== Know When to Give Up

((("giving up, as strategy")))Sometimes no matter how hard you try, you simply need to flip the bozo
bit and move on. Even if you've already spent a lot of attention and
focus trying to correct bad behaviors, you need to know how to
recognize a lost cause.

Let's return to our story about Charlie, the friendly philosopher who
was posting far too often to the Subversion email list. Eventually we
did an analysis of the email discussions and discovered that this
participant had grown into the third most frequent poster over the
course of two months; the first and second most frequent posters were
core project contributors, and 70% of their posts were spent
__replying to Charlie__! Clearly our energy and focus were being
sucked away, despite no ill will from Charlie himself. Our final
solution was to privately email him and (politely) ask him to stop
posting so often. It was a difficult conversation to have, mainly
because he was unable to see the amount of disruption he was
causing. After a few more weeks without a significant behavioral
change, one of us actually had a long (and even more difficult)
discussion with him over the phone where we asked him to stop posting
altogether. He ultimately withdrew as requested, a bit sad and
confused, but respectful of the team's wishes. Everyone felt a little
guilty about it because he never quite understood the harm he was
causing, but everyone also felt it was the right thing to do. It was a
delicate situation to resolve, but we used a great deal of HRT to keep
things civil and appropriate.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch04asciidoc6")))

[[focus_on_the_long_term]]
==== Focus on the Long Term

((("long-term focus", id="ixch04asciidoc7", range="startofrange")))The path to a successful project is ((("distractions")))lined by thousands of
distractions. If there's a common theme in dealing with the
distraction of poisonous people, it's that it's all too easy to get
caught up in the immediate drama of a situation. If you're witnessing
what you think may be poisonous behavior, you need to ask yourself two
critical questions:


* Despite the short-term loss of your team's attention and focus, __do
  you truly believe the project will still benefit in the long run__?


* Do you believe the conflict will ultimately resolve itself in a useful way?


[[image_no_caption-id028]]
image::images/dbtm_04in04.png[]

If your answer to either of these questions is "no," you need to
intervene to stop the behavior as soon as possible. It's easy to
persuade ourselves that the short-term gain of tolerating poison is
worth it, but it usually isn't: for example, somebody may be a great
technical contributor but still exhibit poisonous behavior. There's a
temptation to turn a blind eye to the behavior in order to benefit
from the technical advancement. But be careful! A strong culture based
on HRT is irreplaceable, while technical contributions are
__definitely__ replaceable. To quote a former teammate of ours:

[quote,Greg Hudson]
____ 
I have several friends who know him to some degree. One
of them said, "He often walks the fine line between genius and
lunatic." The problem is, genius is such a commodity these days that
it's not acceptable to be an eccentric anymore.
____


Of course, Greg((("Hudson, Greg"))) isn't talking about literal "genius" here; he's
pointing out that the world is full of highly competent
programmers. If you find one who's offensive or threatens your culture
over the long term, it's best to wait for another one to come along.

We once encountered this sort of situation in the Subversion
project. The team has a strict policy of not putting names into source
code files (the very policy we discussed in
<<building_an_awesome_team_culture>>!): we feel it creates
unmanageable territoriality. People are afraid to change code if it
has somebody else's name on it, and it keeps the bus factor
artificially low. Instead, we allow the version control's history to
credit people appropriately, and we keep a single top-level file with
all the contributors' names in it.

One day a smart programmer showed up and volunteered to write a
sizable new feature that was sorely needed. He submitted the code for
review, and our main feedback was simply requesting that he remove his
name from the top of the file—that we'd credit him in the same places
as everyone else. He refused to do this, however, and the debate led
to an impasse. In the end, the decision was made to reject his code
and he left, taking his toys with him. Of course everyone was
disappointed, but we didn't want to violate our policy (and dilute our
culture) just to get the new feature sooner. A couple of months later,
someone else ended up reimplementing the feature anyway.

To be explicit: __it's not worth compromising your culture for the
short-term__ pass:[<span class="keep-together"><em>gains</em>—</span>]particularly if it's about a brilliant contributor
who doesn't acknowledge the importance of HRT.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch04asciidoc7")))

=== A Final Thought

This chapter discussed quite a number of scenarios, and after taking
everything in it's easy to develop a deep sense of paranoia. Please
remember that most of the world isn't overflowing with jerks.  A
friend of ours once noted, "Yeah, there are only a few crazy people
out there; the Internet just makes it seems like they all live next
door."

((("Hanlon, Robert J.")))((("ignorance, malice vs.")))((("malice, ignorance vs.")))((("stupidity, malice vs.")))Or, as the saying from Robert J. Hanlon goes:

____
Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by pass:[<span class="keep-together">stupidity</span>].
____

We prefer to use the term __ignorance__ rather than __stupidity__, but
the idea is the same. As we mentioned in the beginning, it's naïve to
think of people as Good or Bad. There are very few evil people out
there trying to deliberately crush your culture—most of them are
simply misinformed or misguided. Or perhaps they just want recognition
and are too socially inept to fit in. Either way, your job isn't to
cultivate condescension and lock out the less enlightened peasants
from your project; rather, your job is to be intolerant of destructive
behaviors and to be explicit about your expectations of HRT. It takes
wisdom to understand the difference and real skill to carry it out.(((range="endofrange", startref="ixch04asciidoc0")))
